A map of all locations for the SOTM conferences in 2017.

Read this [Mapbox blog](https://blog.mapbox.com/maps-mapbox-and-state-of-the-map-7e7a6f196962) to know more.

Play with the code on [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/rasagy/dsd1wg2v/).

### To reuse
1. Update the data in json format in the [index.html file](https://github.com/rasagy/sotm2017/blob/master/index.html#L21-L146).
2. Replace the logos in the `logos/` folder, or update the `src` property for the `<img>` tag if you want to directly link the images to a url (from a wiki/website/flickr etc.)
3. Make minor changes like the `<title>` and add your access token (since we keep recycling our access tokens).
